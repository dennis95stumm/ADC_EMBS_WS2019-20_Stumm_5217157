  * @brief This application converts three different signals of three different
  * configureable channels with three Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). Each ADC
  * works independently from the other at the "Single-channel, single conversion
  * mode" triggered by a timer. The signal conversion is triggered by a own timer
  * for each ADC. Depending on the configuration of the three timers the values
  * are converted simultaneous or not. The sampling rate of each ADC can be
  * configured independently. The measurement is started by pressing the user
  * button (PA0) for a defined time and stopped by pressing it for defined time. On
  * rising and falling edge an interrupt gets generated. On rising edge the time
  * of pressure gets saved. On falling edge the time difference betweeng rising
  * and falling edge gets calculated. Depending on the result the measrument gets
  * started (if not already running) or stopped (if not already stopped). The
  * conversion gets started by starting the corresponding timers and adc and
  * stopped by stopping the corresponding timers and adc. During the
  * initialization all information and errors can be printed out via printf
  * depending on the configuration. If the application is ready to start the
  * measurements the green led will be turned on. On errors the red led will be
  * turned on. During measurements the green led will blink. All the
  * configurations of the system can be found in the configuration.h.
  * @test To ensure that the red led is turned on if an error, e.g. wrong
  *   configuration, occurs, the configuration is setup incorrect.
  * @test To ensure that the green led is turned on when the measurement is ready
  *   to start, a flag is turned on that indicates that the system is ready,
  *   which is checked with the STMStudio.
  * @test To ensure that the switch functionallity works correctly the time
  *   of rising, falling edge and their difference is saved into variables, which
  *   displayed in the STMStudio. Also a counter var is declared, which is
  *   increased by each rising edge, so it can be checked how many times the
  *   user button was intended as pressed and it was really pressed.
  * @test The converted value of each ADC gets persisted to a own variable, that
  *   is checked with the STMStudio. To check the functionallity, the PIN is set
  *   to GND (0 V) and to 3 V.
  * @test The value of the SystemTick Timer gets persisted on each EOC interrupt
  *   so that the difference between the conversion of the signals of all three
  *   channels can be checked.
  * @test The printf configurability is checked with the ST-Link Utility by
  *    enabling or disabling the corresponding print informations.
